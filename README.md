# RadarInformer 🚀

**RadarInformer** is a **transformer-based radar data ELINT (Electronic Intelligence) classifier** that leverages **PyTorch** for signal processing and model training. This repository provides a minimal Python notebook demonstrating how to:

- Generate Synthetic Radar Signals
- Convert Signals to a Time-Domain Representation
- Train a Transformer Model to Classify Radar Signals

## 🛠 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/radarinformer.git
cd radarinformer
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

We use `PyTorch`, `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`, and `Jupyter` notebooks.

```bash
pip install torch numpy matplotlib jupyter
```

### 3. Run the Notebook

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/minimal_transformer_example.ipynb
```

This notebook demonstrates how to create synthetic radar signals, transform them into token sequences, and train a simple Transformer classifier.

## 🔧 Key Methods to Update

You only need to modify a few methods to adapt RadarInformer to your own data and experiments. The rest of the code remains general:

### `generate_synthetic_signals(...)`

- **Purpose:** Change the radar signal patterns, SNR levels, or modulation schemes according to your needs.

### `RadarDataset.__getitem__(...)`

- **Purpose:** Adjust how signals are sliced, tokenized, or labeled to match your specific dataset.

### `TransformerClassifier.forward(...)`

- **Purpose:** Modify this method if you need a different Transformer architecture (e.g., altering hidden layers or attention heads).

> **Note:** By customizing these methods, you can quickly prototype transformer-based classification for various radar and ELINT scenarios.

## 📊 Features

- **Synthetic Signal Generation:** Utilizes techniques like spread spectrum and FMCW.
- **Fixed SNR Maintenance:** Maintains a fixed SNR (e.g., 10 dB).
- **Time-Domain Representation:** Transforms raw signals into token sequences, one token per time step.
- **Lightweight Transformer Architecture:** Implements a transformer-based model in PyTorch for efficient classification.

## ⚙️ Usage Example

```python
from src.data import generate_synthetic_signals
from src.model import TransformerClassifier

# Generate synthetic signals
signals = generate_synthetic_signals(snr=10)

# Initialize and train the classifier
model = TransformerClassifier()
model.train(signals)
```
