RadarInformer
RadarInformer is a transformer-based radar data ELINT (Electronic Intelligence) classifier that leverages PyTorch for signal processing and model training. This repository provides a minimal Python notebook demonstrating how to:

Generate Synthetic Radar Signals

Uses techniques like spread spectrum and FMCW.
Maintains a fixed SNR (e.g., 10 dB).
Convert Signals to a Time-Domain Representation

Transforms raw signals into token sequences, one token per time step.
Train a Transformer Model to Classify Radar Signals

Implements a lightweight transformer-based architecture in PyTorch.
Demonstrates classification of different radar signal types.
Repository Contents

README.md
This file. Provides a high-level overview of the project and how to get started.

Getting Started
Clone the Repository

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/username/radarinformer.git
cd radarinformer
Install Dependencies
We use PyTorch, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Jupyter notebooks.

bash
Copy code
pip install torch numpy matplotlib jupyter
Run the Notebook

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook notebooks/minimal_transformer_example.ipynb
This notebook shows how to create synthetic radar signals, transform them into token sequences, and train a simple Transformer classifier.
Key Methods to Update
You only need to modify a few methods to adapt RadarInformer to your own data and experiments. The rest of the code remains general:

generate_synthetic_signals(...)

Change the radar signal patterns, SNR levels, or modulation schemes according to your needs.
RadarDataset.__getitem__(...)

Adjust how signals are sliced, tokenized, or labeled to match your specific dataset.
TransformerClassifier.forward(...)

If you need a different Transformer architecture (e.g., altering hidden layers or attention heads), modify this method.
By customizing these methods, you can quickly prototype transformer-based classification for various radar and ELINT scenarios.
